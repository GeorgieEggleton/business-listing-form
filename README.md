# Introduction
Mandens is a business transfer agents and valuers specialising in the sale of Fish & Chip businesses across the UK.  Established over 50 years ago they are now the leading agent in this sector. 

In order to list a new business for sale the first step of the process is to collect the owners information and some basic trading information of the business in order to generate the legal paperwork. Often collecting this information takes several calls with the owner while they check various pieces of information. 

In order for Mandens to have a more efficient use of the agents time the business listing site developed here will allow the owners of a business to register an account and upload their (or the legal owner of the business) details as well as the business details from home when they have all the information to hand. They will also be able to log back in at any time to view, update or delete the business information if needed. 

The admin (Mandens) will be able to log in and see a full list of all the businesses that are due to be listed with all the required information to generate the legal paperwork needed.

# Features

### Favicon
A favicon is used to help the user identify the correct site when they have multiple tabs open. I have used a custom image which is part of the main Mandes logo.

### Home Page
On first loading the website the user is directed to the homepage. This is styled to look very similar the homepage of the main Mandens website to keep the brand styling continuity and ensure it is easily recognisable to the user. The user has two options, if this is their first time visiting the site they can register and account, or if they have previously done that they can login to edit or delete their business details.

### Registration
If the user is coming to the site for the first time they will click on the “Register” button. This will direct them to the signup page were they will be able to create their account details. 

### Login
If the user is returning to the site having already previously set up their account they will click the “Log In” button. This will redirect them to the singing page where they will just need to enter their username and password. There is also an option to click “Remember Me” it speed up further sign in’s if they are working from the safety of their own private computer. 

### Vendor Details
After registering for an account the user will then be re-directed to the Vendor Input page. This is where the user will be asked to input the details of the legal owner and vendor of the business. All fields in this section are mandatory fields as all this information will be required by the Admin in order to complete the legal paperwork to sell the business. Once they Have done this and clicked “Submit” They will be re-directed to their own personal overview page. 

### Overview Page
The overview page will display to the user all of their personal and business information. In the first instance it will only show the vendor details and below where the businesses will appear is a large button to add a new business. Once the user has added one or more businesses these will all be displayed on the overview page. I have used accordians to list all the businesses as it is possible that one user could have many businesses for sale. The accordions assure that the page is easy to read and manage. When the accordion for each business is clicked it opens and displays the relevant business information.
